# AndriOS-UX
Mostly webview/DAV based, SELinux core-sporting, Omni-ROM wannabe, lovingly constructed by hand, and forcefully versatile thanks to Git, Gist, and Gerrit.  Weekly updates during prototype phase, shooting for nightly builds during the beta testing. Stay tuned, and thanks for looking!  -Professor Coal (your friendly, neighborhood Super-Villain.)
